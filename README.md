## **Model Deployment with Flask**

This repository contains code for deploying a machine learning model using Flask. The model is trained and saved as `model.pt`, and it is deployed as a RESTful API using Flask.

### **Installation**

To install the required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Model on Kaggle

To run the model on Kaggle, follow these steps:

1. Upload the finalimages project to Kaggle.
2. Open a Kaggle kernel or notebook.
3. Ensure the dataset (if any) is accessible or upload it to the kernel.
4. Execute the provided code to train the model and save it as `model.pt`.
5. Download the `model.pt` file from the Kaggle kernel.

## Deploying the Model with Flask

To deploy the model using Flask, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder named `models` in your Flask project directory.
2. Copy the `model.pt` file you downloaded from Kaggle into the `models` folder.
3. Implement Flask API to load the model and make predictions. A basic example is provided in the repository.
4. Run the Flask app and access the prediction endpoint to make predictions.

## Folder Structure

- **models**: This folder contains the trained machine learning model (`model.pt`).
- **app.py**: This file contains the Flask application for model deployment.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the required Python packages for running the application.

## Usage

1. Install the required packages.
2. Train the model on Kaggle or using any other platform and save it as `model.pt`.
3. Deploy the model using Flask by running the `flask_app.py` file.
4. Access the prediction endpoint to make predictions.
